Game Programming
===================

Learning to design and program simple games provides a good context for learning many fundamental computing concepts such as user interaction, collision detection, conditional branching, boolean logic, object oriented design, and state machines.

Links to Game Programming Tutorials
====================================

Listed below are links to some excellent online tutorials and blogs that focus on simple game programming using the `Processing`_ language.  

`Dark Views`_ Writing Games with `Processing`_.
------------------------------------------------
 
	In this set of blog posts, the author creates a set of tutorials about how to develop games in processing. He uses an iterative approach to design a simple game.  He uses an object oriented approach to create a simple game and includes details on how he'd refactor his code after his initial prototype.

`Dr Doane`_ Thinking Through A Basic Pong Game in `Processing`_.
-----------------------------------------------------------------

	This blog provides a very good overview of the problem-solving approach to designing a basic Pong game using `Processing`_. This tutorial uses functional decomposition rather than an object oriented approach so this tutorial can help students understand basic function design including basic collision detection.

`Cate Huston`_ Let's Make a Simplified Game of Pacman. 
---------------------------------------------------------

	This blog tutorial creates a very simple version of Pacman.
