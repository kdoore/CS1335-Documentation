Object Oriented Terminology
============================

We have discussed various concepts related to Object Oriented programming and now we should 
clarify the terminology for many of these concepts.  Let's define the terms:  Polymorphism, 
Function / Method Overloading, and Function / Method Overriding. 

Method / Function Overloading
=============================

We have seen examples of `overloading` when we've used the processing fill() and stroke() functions,
where there are several different versions of these functions, where the function signatures are
unique for each different version.
