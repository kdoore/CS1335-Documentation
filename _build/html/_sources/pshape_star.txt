PShape Objects
===============

The Processing website has a good tutorial about `PShape`_ objects, so it's advisable that you
review that tutorial in order to have a basic understanding of `PShape`_ objects.  The idea is
that `PShape`_ allows us to create geometric primitives that we can use as objects.  There are 
a variety of ways to use PShape, let's start by creating a Star class. 

Stars
=======
In the Processing PShape tutorial, the authors create a Star class, and they use the createShape(), beginShape()
and endShape() functions, along with a list of vertices in the Star constructor to create the geometry for the
Star object.  

However, they go on to describe a subtle concept; the idea of creating the star geometry one time in
the main setup() function, and then passing that PShape object as an input parameter to the Star constructor.  This 
can cut down on rendering costs, where Processing can essentially 'memorize' the geometry of the single PShape object, 
rather than having to render the geometry for each one.  For now, let's ignore these suggestions, and we'll create
the geometry in the Star constructor function.  Below are snippets of code for the Star class, where it inherits
from the Drop class.  For our current version of the RainDrop game, the Drop class does not inherit from any other class::

	class Star extends Drop{
		PShape s;
		
		Star(){  // default constructor
		// First create the shape
    	s = createShape();
    	s.beginShape();
    	// You can set fill and stroke
    	s.fill(102);
    	s.stroke(255);
    	s.strokeWeight(2);
    	// Here, we are hardcoding a series of vertices
    	s.vertex(0, -50);
    	s.vertex(14, -20);
    	s.vertex(47, -15);
    	s.vertex(23, 7);
    	s.vertex(29, 40);
    	s.vertex(0, 25);
    	s.vertex(-29, 40);
    	s.vertex(-23, 7);
    	s.vertex(-47, -15);
    	s.vertex(-14, -20);
    	s.endShape(CLOSE);
  		}
	
	}
