On the processing website, there is a comprehensive `PVector tutorial`_ about the PVector object.  The PVector object is used to represent vector objects, and provides data elements and methods for vector math operations. `A vector is a collection of values that describe relative position in space.`  D. Shiffman - `PVector Tutorial`_. A vector represents the difference between 2 points in space.  When representing a point location, it is assumed that the 0,0 origin is one of the vector endpoints.  The simple ball bouncing animation below gives an example of using the ball's x,y location and adding horizontal speed and vertical speed to the balls current location to animate the motion of the ball.  Location, velocity (speed), and acceleration can all be represented using the PVector object.  The PVector object has methods to add vectors which simplify working with motion in multiple dimensions.  In addition, the PVector object provides a good introduction to object oriented programming.

Bouncing Ball - No Vectors
===========================

In the PVector tutorial and in `Learning Processing`_ Section 5.7, the example programs create a bouncing ball. The bouncing ball programs provide a good example of how to program object motion.
The code below is from the Processing.org `PVector tutorial` and it creates a simple bouncing ball.::

	float x = 100;
	float y = 100;
	float xspeed = 1;
	float yspeed = 3.3;

	void setup() {
	  size(200,200);
	}

	void draw() {
	  fill(255,10);
	  rect(0,0,width,height);  //transparent overlay background

	  // Add the current speed to the location.
	  x = x + xspeed;   
	  y = y + yspeed;

	  // Check for bouncing
	  if ((x > width) || (x < 0)) {
	    xspeed = xspeed * -1;  //reverse speed
	  }
	  if ((y > height) || (y < 0)) {
	    yspeed = yspeed * -1;   //reverse speed
	  }

	  // Display at x,y location
	  fill(175);
	  ellipse(x,y,16,16);
	}
	
Bouncing Ball with PVector
===========================
	
The PVector object provides variables to hold the data of the ball's location coordinates and also provides methods that allow for easy use of vector operations for movement.  In the code above, the ball's location is updated during each loop, so the new location = location + speed, and this is calculated separately for each of our canvas's 2 dimensions: x and y.  We can instead use a PVector to hold the location and another PVector to represent speed, and then we can use the PVector add() method to calculate the new location of the ball. Below is the same bouncing ball program using PVectors for location and velocity.::  
	
	PVector speed = new PVector(1 ,  3.3);  // create a new PVector object instance
	PVector location = new PVector(100,100);  

	void setup() {
	    size(200,200);
	}

	void draw() {
	    fill(255,10);
	    rect(0,0,width,height);  //transparent overlay background

	    // Add the current speed to the location: vector addition
	    location.add(speed);

	    // Check for bouncing
	    if((location.x > width) || (location.x < 0)) {
	      	speed.x = speed.x * -1;  //reverse speed
	    }
	    if ((location.y > height) || (location.y < 0)) {
	      	speed.y = speed.y * -1;   //reverse speed
	    }

	    // Display at x,y location
	    fill(175);
	    ellipse(location.x,location.y,16,16);
	  }

PVector Object
================

The PVector object allows us to explore the processing object syntax.  When we want to create an instance of an object, we use the object's constructor function.  According to the processing PVector reference, the PVector class has 3 different constructor functions. Notice that each constructor has a unique function signature, this is an important concept called function overloading.  We can have several versions of the same function, but the signature of each function must be unique. ::

 	PVector();
	PVector(float x, float y);
	PVector(float x, float y, float z);
	
To create a new instance of a PVector object we must use the Processing object syntax depending on which constructor we choose to use, the default constructor has no arguments, therefore the x and y properties are initialized using `dot` notation.  Dot notation the syntax for calling a class's method  or for setting a property value for a data element that belongs to the object's own object class.  We set the x value of the location PVector instance using ``location.x=100;``  ::

	PVector location = new PVector();  //declare a new PVector object
	location.x= 100;	//initialize the x data element using dot notation
	location.y= 120;	//initialize the y data element using dot notation
	
	PVector speed = new PVector(3 , 4 );  //declare and initialize a new PVector object speed has x,y components
	
    location.add(speed)  //use add method to add vector components of speed to location.
